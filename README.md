This repository contains the digital tools for my research project on the genealogy of food riots in the Eastern Mediterranean between the 18th and the 20th centuries (a short description can be found [here](https://www.orient-institut.org/research/current-projects/women-on-the-streets-a-genealogy-of-food-riots-in-the-middle-east-between-the-18th-and-20th-centuries/)). Most of the code is concerned with extracting, compiling and analysing price information based on TEI encodings and originally collected in my annotations on sources, which I keep in Sente (an outdated but still functional reference manager for OSX/macOS). A detailed description of the encoding practices and my workflows can be found [here](workflow_food-prices.md). The data set(s) are kept in a separate [repository](https://github.com/tillgrallert/food-riots_data).

Due to a number of unforeseen circumstances, I have not been as productive as I wanted with regards to this research project. A paper presenting some results and some of the data was published as Grallert, Till. ‘Urban Food Riots in Late Ottoman Bilād Al-Shām as a “Repertoire of Contention”’. In *Crime, Poverty and Survival in the Middle East and North Africa: The ‘Dangerous Classes’ since 1800*, edited by Stephanie Cronin, 157–76. London: I.B. Tauris, 2019. Slides for my most recent talk can be found [here](https://tillgrallert.github.io/slides/food-riots/2019-oib/index.html).
